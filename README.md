🏃‍♂️ LoopRun - Running Tracking & Route Planning App
LoopRun is a simple web application that allows users to:

✅ Register and log in securely
✅ Track their running distance (km) over time
✅ Plan a circular running route based on their distance target, with start and end at the same location
✅ View their total distance run

Status: The project is under active development, new features and improvements are being added continuously!
